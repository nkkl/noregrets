Do you have an Apple product like an "i Phone" or "i Pad"? Do you need to charge it? Do you like money? You should just buy this [Amazon Basics Lightning Cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Apple-Certified-Lightning-Cable/dp/B010S9N6OO/ref=pd_lpo_107_bs_t_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=8H78REGYMT3WXHQWW78P) instead of the $29 Apple one, cause it's fine and it's like $8.
